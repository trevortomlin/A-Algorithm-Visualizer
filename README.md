# A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer
## Gui that visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm 
![](https://raw.github.com/trevortomlin/A-Star-Algorithm-Visualizer/master/algorithmimage.png)

**How to use:** 
1. Run the program.
2. Press S to select a start point.
3. Press E to select an ending point.
4. Press W to select any amount of walls.
5. Press Return to see the algorithm run.

I spent far too long on this project and was unable to completely finish it. I am taking a break from this project and I might come back to fix it later. This program shows how to create a window, handle user input, and to use a pathfinding algorithm. The algorithm correctly finds a valid path, however, it is not the shortest path.

### What I learned from this project:
- How to use Git and Github for version control.
- Using classes to make more readable and faster code.
- How to use Pygame to display things on the screen.
- Pathfinding algorithms.

### What I need to work on:
- Knowing when to quit a project and move on.
- Debugging.
- Implementing classes.
