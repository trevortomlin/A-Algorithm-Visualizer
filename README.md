<img src="algorithmimage.png" width=40% height=40%>

## Description
This projects visualizes the pathfinding algorithm A* using a grid. It uses Pygame for the window and user input. The algorithm is implemented using a Priority Queue and is guaranteed to find the shortest path if there is one.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Press S to select a start point.
3. Press E to select an ending point.
4. Press W to select any amount of walls.
5. Press Enter to see the algorithm run.

## Technologies Used
Python, pygame, Priority Queues

## Improvements
 - Clean up some messy code.
 - Make sure variables and functions are named properly.
